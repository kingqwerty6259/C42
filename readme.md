**Object Oriented Programming Concepts**
class - The blueprint to create an object. Properties and functions of an object are mentioned inside the class. Properties are given inside the constructor. 
object - An instance of a class. An object is a real world entity.
abstraction - Hiding off the data. 
Inheritance - The process of deriving one class from another one. The keyword extends is used while deriving the class from the baseclass. The function super() is used to derive properties from the parent constructor to the sub-class constructor.

**physics engine**
*class 26* - git - git is a tool in github which is used to track all changes made in the code.
pwd - present working directory
cd - change directory
mkdir - make directory
ls - list files

*class 27* - constraint - It is something that connects two bodies together.The movement of one object is completely dependent on another.

*class 28* - point - Points are represented by their coordinates. - {x:value, y:value}

*class 31* - array - An array is a data type that can hold multiple data types in a single variable. An array can be accessed using its index.
push operation in an array - When you push a data type into an array, it will be pushed as the last element in the index.
pop operation in an array - When you use the pop operation in an array, the last data type in the index will be removed.

*class 32* - api - An api is able to fetch information from a website. JSON is a format that can store information. JSON syntax is {label:value}
JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation.


**Database Creation**
*class 33* - database - A database is used to store information from different devices. A database can also be used to get information after they are being saved. Databases can synchronize different data types together.
.on() - It is used for creating a listener
.ref() - It refers to the database
.val() - gets data from the database
.set() - edits code in the database
.once() - Used as a listener when its a synchronus function

calling static function - Class.functionname()


**for loop**
for (initialization expression; conditional expression; increment operator){
    #action to be performed 
}


**arthimetic operators**
+,-,/,*,%
**modulus operator**

The mosulus operator gives the output as the remainder of a normal division sequence. Ex: 120 / 60 = 2, 120 % 6 = 0

**While Loop**
While (condition){
    #action to be performed
}

**logical operator**
OR operator - ||
AND operator - &&
